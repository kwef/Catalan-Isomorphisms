Catalan-Isomorphisms
====================

Experiments with type-safe encoding and translation of various mathematical objects which are counted by the Catalan numbers, such as Dyck paths, ordered trees, binary trees, and others.

The central type defined in this module is that of a [Dyck path](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DyckPath.html) — a lattice path which does not cross below the diagonal and terminates at the same height at which it began (illustrated below courtesy of [Journal of Statistical Mechanics](http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-5468/2009/03/P03025/fulltext/)).
